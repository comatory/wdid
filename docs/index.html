      <code>wdid</code> is a command-line tool that can help you remember what you worked on during the day.
      It should be used within workplace where daily SCRUM stand-ups are used. This tool can generate such a stand-up and much more.
    </p>

    <h3 class="content__subtitle">Why?</h3>
    <p>
      I created this tool for myself because I often could not recall what I did previous day during stand-up meeting. Sometimes it'd be hard for me to exactly remember what I was planning to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <code>wdid</code> I can create an entry before the meeting. This tool asks series of pre-defined questions that are typical for stand-ups.
      During the meeting I can simply recall the latest stand-up entry I created and report to team on my plan for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>wdid</code> stores these stand-ups in a single sqlite database file so I can always list the data I entered which is ordere chronologically. It is also simple to move the data between machines.
    </p>
    <h3 class="content__subtitle">How does it work?</h3>
    <em>TBD</em>
